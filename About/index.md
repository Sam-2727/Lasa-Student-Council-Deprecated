# Purpose #
The Student Council is LASA’s student government organization, made up of four elected officers from each class. Officers serve as the community and social chairs of the school– acting as class organizers, student advocates, morale officers, and major project planners among many other dutes and responsibilities.
# Activities throughout the year #
Some Activities that Student Council is in charge of planning are:
* Homecoming
* Prom
* Candy grams
* Teacher appreciation cards and gifts
* Organizing a class-wide gift exchange
* Facilitate the decision of the new LASA mascot and school colors (currently)
* Decorating hallways for important events, including homecoming and holiday flair (typically the week before finals)
* Making freshmen feel welcome (and all grades, of course)
* Organizing class socials (where food is handed out to the respective classes)
* Maintaining a class-wide communication system with at least 2/3rds of the class (typically through a remind system)
* Keeping their respective classes informed of various activities
* Raising money through fundraising events for other major events that lose money
* Creating and selling class t-shirts
* Attending CAC meetings once a month
* Running student council elections
* Fulfilling any requests of administrators
* Taking-- and implementing-- suggestions from the student body

The activities that student council does, however, vary widely from year to year based off of the decisions
